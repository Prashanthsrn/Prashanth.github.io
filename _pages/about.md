Welcome to my corner of the web! Iâ€™m an AI enthusiast with a love for building cool stuff that merges creativity and technology. My journey in tech has been quite an adventure, from dabbling in game development to diving deep into generative AI.

Iâ€™ve always been curious about how things work, which naturally led me to explore the world of Artificial Intelligence. Whether itâ€™s creating AI that can outsmart players in a game or designing tools that bring creative visions to life, Iâ€™m all about pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.

When Iâ€™m not coding or experimenting with new ideas, youâ€™ll find me learning something new, probably related to AI (because letâ€™s be honest, thereâ€™s always something new in this field!). My goal? To create tech thatâ€™s not just innovative but also makes life a bit more interesting and fun.

Feel free to explore my projects, and if something catches your eye, letâ€™s chat! Iâ€™m always up for a good conversation about AI, games, or the next big idea.
