Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I am passionate about staying active and exploring creative outlets

**Running**: I’m passionate about running and would consider it an essential part of my daily life. I’ve nailed a sub-2 hour half marathon and even tackled a full marathon in just over 5 hours. Always up for the next big run!

**Painting**: I like to paint whenever I get the chance, using charcoal, acrylic, and water paints to bring my ideas to life, whether inspired by nature or abstract concepts.

**Tennis**:  Playing tennis is one of my favorite ways to stay active. Whether I’m playing a casual game with friends or in a competitive match, it’s a fantastic way to enjoy the sport and keep my reflexes sharp.

**Tabla**: Music has a special place in my life. I spent four years learning the tabla and still enjoy drumming out rhythms whenever I can.
