his paper introduces a new model by combining deep learning with reinforcement learning, specifically to handle high dimensional inputs like raw images. The researchers developed the Deep Q-networks, which uses convolutional neural networks to process high-dimensional data. This is used to train an agent to play Atari games, without any game specific information. The agent takes in consecutive raw images as input, to identify motion, and is trained to play the game using reinforcement learning. The DQN achieved human-level performance in several Atari games, showcasing a potential for more generalized learning in complex environments.
